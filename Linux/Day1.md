# 📂 Linux Directory Structure - A Must-Know for Every DevOps & Cloud Engineer

Understanding the Linux filesystem is essential for every DevOps, Cloud, and SRE professional. Whether you're building containers, debugging EC2 instances, or provisioning infrastructure with Terraform or Ansible — **this knowledge is foundational**.

## 🗂️ Linux Directory Tree Overview

Linux uses a hierarchical **tree-like directory structure**, starting from the root `/`. Below is a breakdown of critical directories:

| Directory       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `/`            | Root directory. Everything begins here. |
| `/bin`         | Essential user binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`) — required in single-user or recovery mode. |
| `/sbin`        | System binaries (e.g., `ifconfig`, `reboot`) — generally used by `root`. |
| `/etc`         | Configuration files for the system and services (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`). |
| `/home`        | Home directories for users (e.g., `/home/sohel`). |
| `/root`        | Root user’s home directory. |
| `/var`         | Variable files like logs (`/var/log`), cache, and mail. |
| `/tmp`         | Temporary files, auto-deleted on reboot. |
| `/usr`         | User-installed applications and utilities (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`). |
| `/lib`, `/lib64` | Shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`. |
| `/opt`         | Optional/custom third-party software installations. |
| `/dev`         | Device files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks, `/dev/null`). |
| `/proc`        | Virtual filesystem for kernel and process info (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`). |
| `/mnt`, `/media` | Temporary mount points for external devices or NFS shares. |

## ❓ Why This Structure Exists

| Principle        | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| 🧩 **Modularity**     | Keeps OS components separate for clarity and maintainability. |
| 🔐 **Security**       | Ensures separation of binaries and configuration for tighter access control. |
| 🛠 **Recovery**       | Guarantees critical tools are available even in minimal boot states. |
| 🌍 **Standardization** | Follows the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)](https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/index.html), crucial for CI/CD, automation, and portability. |

## 🚀 DevOps Pro Tips

- Use `/opt` or `/usr/local/bin` for custom apps and scripts in Docker images.
- Monitor logs in `/var/log` during server provisioning or debugging.
- Leverage `/etc` for automation tasks in Ansible, Chef, or Puppet.
- Mount external volumes at `/mnt` or `/media` in cloud environments (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Inspect `/proc` and `/sys` for real-time kernel and system information during incident response.
