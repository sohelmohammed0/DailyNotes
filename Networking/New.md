## 1. What is an IP Address?
- **Definition:** An IP (Internet Protocol) address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
- **IPv4 format:** 32 bits split into four octets (8 bits each), written in dotted decimal, e.g. `192.168.1.10`.
- **Why binary?** Networks operate on bits. Subnet masks and network math are easiest to understand in binary.

**Quick example**

| Decimal      | Binary (8 bits)     |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 192          | 11000000            |
| 168          | 10101000            |
| 1            | 00000001            |
| 10           | 00001010            |

âœ… **Task 1.1:** Convert `172.16.5.200` into binary (4 octets).  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* Convert each octet separately using the bit weights (128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1).

---

## 2. Binary â‡„ Decimal Conversion â€” Detailed Series
This section teaches **two methods** for each direction and gives plenty of examples and practice tasks. Learn both methods â€” you'll use the faster one in exams and interviews, and the slower method when you first start.

### 2.1 Bit Weights (the primary method)
Every 8-bit octet is a sum of bit weights:

```
128  64  32  16  8  4  2  1
```

**Decimal â†’ Binary (method A: subtractive weights)**
1. Start with the decimal value (0â€“255).
2. Check if 128 fits. If yes, write `1` and subtract 128; else write `0` and keep value.
3. Move to 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 repeating step 2.
4. You will end with 8 bits.

**Example A1: Convert 156**
- 156 â‰¥ 128 â†’ 1 (rem = 28)
- 28 â‰¥ 64 â†’ 0
- 28 â‰¥ 32 â†’ 0
- 28 â‰¥ 16 â†’ 1 (rem = 12)
- 12 â‰¥ 8 â†’ 1 (rem = 4)
- 4 â‰¥ 4 â†’ 1 (rem = 0)
- 2,1 â†’ 0,0
- Result â†’ `10011100`

**Example A2: Convert 203**
- 203 â‰¥ 128 â†’ 1 (rem 75)
- 75 â‰¥ 64 â†’ 1 (rem 11)
- 11 â‰¥ 32 â†’ 0
- 11 â‰¥ 16 â†’ 0
- 11 â‰¥ 8 â†’ 1 (rem 3)
- 3 â‰¥ 4 â†’ 0
- 3 â‰¥ 2 â†’ 1 (rem 1)
- 1 â‰¥ 1 â†’ 1
- Result â†’ `11001011`

**Decimal â†’ Binary (method B: repeated division)**
1. Divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder (0/1).
2. Set the quotient for the next division and repeat until quotient = 0.
3. The binary number is the remainders read from **bottom (last)** to **top (first)**, pad to 8 bits.

**Example B1: Convert 45**
- 45 Ã· 2 = 22 r 1
- 22 Ã· 2 = 11 r 0
- 11 Ã· 2 = 5 r 1
- 5 Ã· 2 = 2 r 1
- 2 Ã· 2 = 1 r 0
- 1 Ã· 2 = 0 r 1 â†’ read up: `101101` â†’ pad to 8 bits `00101101`

**Task 2.1:** Convert these decimals to binary: `201`, `77`, `50`. Use method A (weights).  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* Use the bit weights row and subtract.

---

### 2.2 Binary â†’ Decimal (weights method â€” recommended)
Multiply each bit by its weight and sum:

`bit7*128 + bit6*64 + bit5*32 + bit4*16 + bit3*8 + bit2*4 + bit1*2 + bit0*1`

**Example 1: `11000000` â†’**
- 1*128 + 1*64 + 0*32 + 0*16 + 0*8 + 0*4 + 0*2 + 0*1 = 128 + 64 = 192

**Example 2: `00101101` â†’**
- 0*128 + 0*64 + 1*32 + 0*16 + 1*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 = 32 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 45

**Task 2.2:** Convert these binaries to decimal: `10101100`, `00010110`, `00110010`.  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* Multiply and add the set bit weights.

---

### 2.3 Quick Tricks & Shortcuts
- Memorize powers: 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1.
- For numbers less than 128, the leftmost bit is 0 â€” start from 64.
- For fast mental conversion: break the byte into nibbles (4 bits): high nibble (bits 128-16) and low nibble (8-1). Convert each nibble separately and combine.

**Nibble example:** 156 = `1001 1100` â†’ high nibble `1001` = 9 (Ã—16 = 144), low nibble `1100` = 12 â†’ 144 + 12 = 156.

**Task 2.3 (fast shortcut):** Convert 173 to binary using nibble method.  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* 173 = 160 + 13 â†’ think in nibbles.

---

### 2.4 Practice & Answer Key (for Section 2)
**Practice (do these without peeking)**
- A: Decimalâ†’Binary: `201`, `77`, `50`.
- B: Binaryâ†’Decimal: `10101100`, `00010110`, `00110010`.
- C: Fast nibble: `173`.

## 3. Subnet Mask and CIDR (including /8 and other common prefixes)
- CIDR `/n` = number of consecutive `1` bits from the left.
- Common masks table (expanded including /8):

| Prefix | Mask (dotted)        | Binary                         | Host bits | Total Addr | Usable Hosts |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------:|-----------:|-------------:|
| /8     | 255.0.0.0            | 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 | 24 | 16,777,216 | 16,777,214 |
| /12    | 255.240.0.0          | 11111111.11110000.00000000.00000000 | 20 | 1,048,576  | 1,048,574  |
| /16    | 255.255.0.0          | 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000 | 16 | 65,536     | 65,534     |
| /20    | 255.255.240.0        | 11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000 | 12 | 4,096      | 4,094      |
| /24    | 255.255.255.0        | 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | 8  | 256        | 254        |
| /26    | 255.255.255.192      | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000 | 6  | 64         | 62         |
| /28    | 255.255.255.240      | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000 | 4  | 16         | 14         |
| /30    | 255.255.255.252      | 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111100 | 2  | 4          | 2          |

âœ… **Task 3.1:** What is the dotted mask for `/9` and how many usable hosts does it provide?  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* `/9` = `11111111.10000000.00000000.00000000`.

## 4. Network Address (bitwise AND) â€” step-by-step
**Method (binary AND)**
1. Convert IP to 32-bit binary (four 8-bit octets).
2. Convert mask to binary (CIDR â†’ mask).
3. AND each corresponding bit (1&1=1; else 0).
4. Convert the result back to decimal â€” that is the network address.

**Shortcut (block-size method)**
- Find the octet where the mask is not 255 (the interesting octet).
- Block size = 256 âˆ’ mask_octet.
- Subnet boundaries are 0, block, 2*block, 3*blockâ€¦ find which block the IP falls into â†’ that's the network.

**Task 4.1:** Find the network for `198.51.100.46/26` using the block-size method.  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* last octet mask = 192 â†’ block size = 64.

---

## 5. Broadcast Address (how to compute)
Two equivalent methods:
- **Method A:** set all host bits to `1` in the network binary.
- **Method B:** Broadcast = Network + (2^(host_bits) âˆ’ 1).

**Task 5.1:** For network `198.51.100.0/26`, find the broadcast.  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* host bits = 6 â†’ 2^6 âˆ’ 1 = 63.

---

## 6. Usable Host Range & Host Count
- **Total addresses** in subnet = 2^(host_bits).
- **Usable hosts** normally = total âˆ’ 2 (excluding network and broadcast), except for special cases (/31 and /32).

**Task 6.1:** For `/30` subnets used in point-to-point links, how many usable hosts are there and why?  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* host bits = 2 â†’ 2^2 = 4 addresses.

---

## 7. Public vs Private IPs (table + examples)

| Range                | CIDR(s)              | Type     | Example Use                   |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 10.0.0.0 â€“ 10.255.255.255 | 10.0.0.0/8         | Private  | Large private networks        |
| 172.16.0.0 â€“ 172.31.255.255 | 172.16.0.0/12    | Private  | Medium-sized private networks |
| 192.168.0.0 â€“ 192.168.255.255 | 192.168.0.0/16  | Private  | Home & small office LANs      |
| 127.0.0.0 â€“ 127.255.255.255 | 127.0.0.0/8       | Loopback | Local host (127.0.0.1)        |
| 169.254.0.0 â€“ 169.254.255.255 | 169.254.0.0/16 | Link-local | APIPA (DHCP failure)         |
| 224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255 | 224.0.0.0/4     | Multicast | Group communications         |

âœ… **Task 7.1:** Is `172.20.5.10` public or private?  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* check the 172.16.0.0/12 block.

---

## 8. Common Subnetting Techniques & Shortcuts
- **Block-size**: quickest for manual test-taking.
- **Borrowing bits**: split a large network into smaller ones.
- **VLSM**: allocate different sizes to different subnets efficiently.

**Task 8.1:** From `192.168.0.0/24`, how many `/26` subnets can you create?  
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* Each `/26` has 64 addresses; how many 64-address blocks in 256?

---

## 9. Worked Examples (step-by-step)
- Many examples included earlier in the document are kept here for quick reference: `/24`, `/20`, `/26`, `/28` walkthroughs.

âœ… **Task 9.1:** Try `203.0.113.45/28` â€” find network, broadcast & usable.
ðŸ’¡ *Hint:* /28 has block size 16 inside last octet.
