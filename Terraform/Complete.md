# Terraform Complete Notes

This document covers the fundamentals of Terraform, all 9 blocks, basic commands, and scenario-based questions with answers. It is structured to help even beginners understand Terraform step by step.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers using configuration files.

- **Declarative**: You declare the final desired state, and Terraform figures out how to achieve it.
- **Cloud-agnostic**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and many more providers.
- **Idempotent**: Running the same configuration multiple times produces the same result.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Why use Terraform?
- Automates infrastructure provisioning.
- Infrastructure as Code (version controlled).
- Multi-cloud support.
- Reusable modules.
- Collaboration with remote backends.
- Safe and predictable with execution plans.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Terraform Blocks

Terraform uses blocks to define configurations. Each block has its purpose. There are **9 important blocks**:

### 1. `terraform` Block
- Defines required Terraform version and provider versions.
- Helps avoid compatibility issues in teams/projects.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *What happens if team members use different versions?*  
  Resources may behave differently, attributes may break. Pinning ensures consistency.

---

### 2. `provider` Block
- Acts as a **communication bridge** between Terraform and the cloud provider.
- Example: AWS, Azure, Google.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *Why is it mandatory?* â†’ Without it, Terraform doesnâ€™t know where to create resources.  
- *What if managing multiple regions/accounts?* â†’ Use **aliases** for multiple provider blocks.  
- *What if region is missing?* â†’ Terraform throws an error.

---

### 3. `resource` Block
- The most important block â€” tells Terraform **what to create** (e.g., EC2, S3).

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *What happens when applied?* â†’ Terraform creates the resource in the provider cloud.  
- *What if deleted from code?* â†’ Terraform destroys it on the next `apply`.

---

### 4. `variable` Block
- Allows defining dynamic values instead of hardcoding.  
- Can take values via `terraform.tfvars`, CLI, or environment.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *Why use variables?* â†’ Flexibility and reusability across environments.

---

### 5. `output` Block
- Prints important values after resources are created.  
- Example: public IP, resource ID.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *Why useful?* â†’ Helps pass values to other tools/modules or for quick references.

---

### 6. `locals` Block
- Defines local reusable values.  
- Helps simplify complex expressions.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *Why use locals if variables exist?* â†’ For computed or helper values that donâ€™t need external input.

---

### 7. `data` Block
- Fetches **read-only information** from provider.  
- Example: Latest AMI ID in AWS.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *Why use it?* â†’ Avoids hardcoding, always fetches the latest available.

---

### 8. `backend` Block
- Manages **state storage** (local or remote).  
- Remote backends allow collaboration.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *What if using local state in teams?* â†’ State conflicts, overwrites.  
- *Why S3 + DynamoDB for teams?* â†’ Versioning + state locking.

---

### 9. `module` Block
- Reusable container of Terraform code.  
- Helps maintain DRY principle.

**Scenario Q&A:**
- *Why use modules?* â†’ To standardize and reuse infrastructure patterns.  
- *Example:* One VPC module reused in multiple regions.

## ðŸ“Œ Basic Terraform Commands

1. `terraform init` â†’ Initializes working directory, downloads providers.  
2. `terraform validate` â†’ Validates configuration syntax.  
3. `terraform plan` â†’ Shows what Terraform will create/change/destroy.  
4. `terraform apply` â†’ Executes the plan and provisions resources.  
5. `terraform destroy` â†’ Destroys infrastructure.  
6. `terraform fmt` â†’ Formats configuration files.  
7. `terraform show` â†’ Shows current state.  
8. `terraform state` â†’ Advanced state file operations.

**What happens in each step?**
- `init`: Prepares working dir.  
- `plan`: Compares code with state file.  
- `apply`: Executes changes.  
- `destroy`: Removes resources safely.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Multi-Region Concept (Aliasing Providers)

If you want resources in **two AWS regions**:
- Define **two provider blocks** with different `alias`.  
- Assign resources to providers using `provider = aws.use1` or `aws.aps1`.

Example (Conceptual):
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  alias  = "use1"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
  alias  = "aps1"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "use1_vpc" {
  provider = aws.use1
  # vpc details
}

resource "aws_vpc" "aps1_vpc" {
  provider = aws.aps1
  # vpc details
}
```

This allows managing both regions in one codebase.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Best Practices
- Always pin Terraform and provider versions.  
- Use remote backend for teams.  
- Use variables for flexibility.  
- Organize with modules.  
- Never edit state file manually.  
- Follow Git for version control.
